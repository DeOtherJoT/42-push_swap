Currently the sorting algorithm does not work for numbers past 200. Need to redo decide_partition to only stop when
len_a is <= 3.
Currently takes too many moves for 100 numbers. Time to get hands dirty and actually study up on the recursive side of
things. Study on Quick Sort, pivot being the median of each partition.
