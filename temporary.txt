This file contains a list of stuff that are temporary, albeit functions, elements or otherwise.
These temporary stuff are to be deleted before the final product is created.

Temporary struct elements :-
size_t	moves;

Temporary Functions :-
< Main Folder >
ft_print_stacks();
ft_mini_checker();

Temporary Parameters :-
process_input(elem_num);


Currently the sorting algorithm does not work for numbers past 200. Need to redo decide_partition to only stop when
len_a is <= 3.
Currently takes too many moves for 100 numbers. Time to get hands dirty and actually study up on the recursive side of
things. Study on Quick Sort, pivot being the median of each partition.

Okay, I tried to be lazy and just do more partitions. That didn't work. Time to actually try recursivity? :(


Generally have something that works, only problem now is that sometimes the get_target fails. Need to figure out
why it fails. I think it occurs when the elem is the smallest when it is about to be inserted into stack_a.
Good luck, tomorrow me.
